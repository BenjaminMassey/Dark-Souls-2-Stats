#Dark Souls II stats calculator
Copyright (c) 2014 Benjamin Massey

A basic tool for finding out information about your character based on his/her stats.
The health calculation is very complex in Dark Souls II, so the health calculation in
DS2Stats.py is purely an estimate. Everything else should be exact. Because of this, 
I have not yet included health in DS2StatsGUI.py. It would take some more work to
get health calculation on the GUI, and I do not consider it worth the time until the
health calculation is actually accurate. Once I do have it more accurate, it will be
added to the GUI. Contact me through github about any errors that you may come across
while using these programs. These programs requires further testing, and were mainly 
made as a project to practice programming in Python.

Wanted to thank TheReimber for his tutorial about Python Tkinter on YouTube, it
helped me to create the GUI, so I thought that I should credit him.
