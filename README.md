#Dark Souls II stats calculator
Copyright (c) 2014 Benjamin Massey

A basic tool for finding out information about your character based on his/her stats.
The health calculation is very complex in Dark Souls II, so the health that this
program gives you is purely an estimate. Everything else should be exact. Contact
me through github about any errors that you may come across while using it. This
program requires further testing, and was mainly made as a project to practice
programming in Python.
